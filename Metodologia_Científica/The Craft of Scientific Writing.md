# Introduction
* All decisions about writing fall under one of three categories: content, style or  form.
* Content is what you wish to convey. In scientific writing, content varies widely—from experiments on atomic particles to theories about solar galaxies.
* Style, on the other hand, is how you convey the content to the audience.
* Form then consists of the writing rules that readers expect you to follow, such as how to use a colon properly, when to
write out a number, or the guidelines for inserting a reference listing into the text. 

# Analyzing the Audience, Purpose, and Occasion
* Titles strongly influence whether the audience will read, file, or discard the document.
* Before spending the energy to write sentences in a
scientific document, you should analyze the document’s audience. 
* In addition, you should analyze two other constraints of the document: purpose and occasion.
* while a sports reporter for a newspaper targets an audience with the same general understanding of a sport, an engineer or scientist often faces audiences with widely different levels of understanding about the subject.
* With each document, you should assess the following
three questions about audience:
    1. who is the audience?
    2. why is the audience reading?
    3. what does the audience know?
* Answering the first question of who the audience is reveals how challenging the document will be to write.
* In still more difficult documents, that varied audience might include people with no background in science—politicians, for example. 
* Answering the second question of why the audience is reading tells you what information the audience needs or wants. Knowing that, you can define the document’s scope: what work to include and what to leave out. In addition, you can determine which findings to emphasize.
* Answering the third question of what the audience knows about the content helps you decide which order to arrange the content, which terms to define, and what background to include. When you have a mixture of audiences, you should assess which readers are your primary audience.
* For documents that contain unexpected or controversial findings, you should explore this third question at a deeper level by also considering what the audience believes about the content. In particular, you should consider the audience’s initial bias toward your conclusions. With an audience holding a neutral stance about your conclusions, an assertion-evidence approach works well [4]. In this approach, you build an argument on assertions (or claims) that are supported by evidence from your theories, computations, and experiments. However, relying solely on an assertion-evidence approach often falters if the audience holds a deep-seated biased against your conclusions. In such cases, you would do better to craft an argument that first shows your understanding of the audience’s initial position on the question [5]. Then you present your evidence for the question, before revealing your stance (or assertion) on the question.
* Besides audience, another important constraint for a scientific document is the purpose. In scientific writing, you write for two specific goals: to inform and to persuade.
* When the purpose of your writing includes persuasion, another measure for success comes into play: your credibility. For such writing, it is not enough that the audience simply understands your content. In such writing, the audience continually questions your content and therefore is interested not only in the what, where, when, and how but also the why.
* in a persuasive document, some sentences that you write are not to aid the audience’s understanding but to build your credibility.
* While the style of having vertical lists serves the purpose of instructions, this style is not effective in persuasive documents. When reading an argument, the audience expects strong links between the ideas. For that reason, persuasive writing calls for full-fledged paragraphs. Unfortunately, many engineers and scientists fail to realize this difference in style. Rather, these authors litter their persuasive reports with vertical lists that disrupt the continuity and do not show the connections. 
* In addition, the paragraphs of persuasive writing are typically longer than paragraphs of primarily informative writing. One reason is that in persuasive writing, the author addresses the question of why. For instance, in a proposal for an experiment that measures blood flow through a heart valve, the reader cares deeply not only about what measurement technique the author has chosen but also why the author selected that technique. Such a choice warrants an explanation, which leads to longer paragraphs.
* Form. In scientific writing, form comprises not only the rules of grammar, punctuation, usage, and spelling but also the guidelines for length and format.
* However, another important goal is to understand grammar well enough to write sophisticated sentences—sentences that connect ideas in efficient ways, that emphasize important details, and that produce enough variety to drive readers through longer documents. For such an understanding of grammar, you should be able to recognize the basic parts of speech: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, and conjunction.
