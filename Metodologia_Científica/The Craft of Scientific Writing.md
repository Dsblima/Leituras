# Introduction
* All decisions about writing fall under one of three categories: content, style or  form.
* Content is what you wish to convey. In scientific writing, content varies widely—from experiments on atomic particles to theories about solar galaxies.
* Style, on the other hand, is how you convey the content to the audience.
* Form then consists of the writing rules that readers expect you to follow, such as how to use a colon properly, when to
write out a number, or the guidelines for inserting a reference listing into the text. 

# Lesson 1 - Analyzing the Audience, Purpose, and Occasion
* Titles strongly influence whether the audience will read, file, or discard the document.
* Before spending the energy to write sentences in a
scientific document, you should analyze the document’s audience. 
* In addition, you should analyze two other constraints of the document: purpose and occasion.
* while a sports reporter for a newspaper targets an audience with the same general understanding of a sport, an engineer or scientist often faces audiences with widely different levels of understanding about the subject.
* With each document, you should assess the following
three questions about audience:
    1. who is the audience?
    2. why is the audience reading?
    3. what does the audience know?
* Answering the first question of who the audience is reveals how challenging the document will be to write.
* In still more difficult documents, that varied audience might include people with no background in science—politicians, for example. 
* Answering the second question of why the audience is reading tells you what information the audience needs or wants. Knowing that, you can define the document’s scope: what work to include and what to leave out. In addition, you can determine which findings to emphasize.
* Answering the third question of what the audience knows about the content helps you decide which order to arrange the content, which terms to define, and what background to include. When you have a mixture of audiences, you should assess which readers are your primary audience.
* For documents that contain unexpected or controversial findings, you should explore this third question at a deeper level by also considering what the audience believes about the content. In particular, you should consider the audience’s initial bias toward your conclusions. With an audience holding a neutral stance about your conclusions, an assertion-evidence approach works well [4]. In this approach, you build an argument on assertions (or claims) that are supported by evidence from your theories, computations, and experiments. However, relying solely on an assertion-evidence approach often falters if the audience holds a deep-seated biased against your conclusions. In such cases, you would do better to craft an argument that first shows your understanding of the audience’s initial position on the question [5]. Then you present your evidence for the question, before revealing your stance (or assertion) on the question.
* Besides audience, another important constraint for a scientific document is the purpose. In scientific writing, you write for two specific goals: to inform and to persuade.
* When the purpose of your writing includes persuasion, another measure for success comes into play: your credibility. For such writing, it is not enough that the audience simply understands your content. In such writing, the audience continually questions your content and therefore is interested not only in the what, where, when, and how but also the why.
* in a persuasive document, some sentences that you write are not to aid the audience’s understanding but to build your credibility.
* While the style of having vertical lists serves the purpose of instructions, this style is not effective in persuasive documents. When reading an argument, the audience expects strong links between the ideas. For that reason, persuasive writing calls for full-fledged paragraphs. Unfortunately, many engineers and scientists fail to realize this difference in style. Rather, these authors litter their persuasive reports with vertical lists that disrupt the continuity and do not show the connections. 
* In addition, the paragraphs of persuasive writing are typically longer than paragraphs of primarily informative writing. One reason is that in persuasive writing, the author addresses the question of why. For instance, in a proposal for an experiment that measures blood flow through a heart valve, the reader cares deeply not only about what measurement technique the author has chosen but also why the author selected that technique. Such a choice warrants an explanation, which leads to longer paragraphs.
* Form. In scientific writing, form comprises not only the rules of grammar, punctuation, usage, and spelling but also the guidelines for length and format.
* However, another important goal is to understand grammar well enough to write sophisticated sentences—sentences that connect ideas in efficient ways, that emphasize important details, and that produce enough variety to drive readers through longer documents. For such an understanding of grammar, you should be able to recognize the basic parts of speech: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, and conjunction. 

# Lesson 2 - Balancing Precision with Clarity
* Einstein’s advice to keep the language as simple as possible, yet no simpler, calls for a balance between being precise and being clear. Foremost, your scientific writing has to be precise.
* In addition, achieving this balance of precision and clarity requires you to find the appropriate level of detail for the audience and then, as Einstein said, avoid any complexity above that level. Moreover, this balance should apply not only to your language but also to your illustrations.


### Choose the right word
*  As an engineer or scientist, you would not choose the word weight when you mean mass. Technical terms such as weight and mass have specific meanings.
* In scientific writing, you should not select a word unless you are sure of its meaning.
*In other words, the physicist wrote the sentence as if being fluid was more important than being precise—a stylistic choice sometimes appropriate for poetry but not for scientific writing.
* Most professional writers, including fiction writers, do not hesitate to repeat a word if that word is the right word. To find the right word, you will want to use a dictionary, not a thesaurus. While a thesaurus identifies possible right words, a good dictionary reveals the subtle differences between those possibilities.
*  Two words to take special care with are prove and optimal.

### Avoid needless complexity
* For instance, in this example, we could find simpler substitutes for the words hitherto, nevertheless, and generalization. Another source of needless complexity in scientific writing occurs at the sentence level. In the Bohr example, the sentences average almost 40 words, which is too long. For clear writing, your sentence length in a document should average in the teens.

#### Avoid needless complex words
* One counterargument for relying exclusively on simpler words is that occasionally using a sophisticated word, such as myriad, shows the audience that you have a wide vocabulary, which in turn can increase your credibility. I agree. However, in being sophisticated, you need not be complicated
* In addition, if you use a sophisticated word such as comprise, you need to ensure that the word is correct. 
* Rather than selecting a long word such as exacerbate, you can show that you have a wide vocabulary with short words such as abate, deter, impede, and spate. Although all of these words are old and have specific meanings, they are seldom written.
* No single typographical change slows the writing more than placing the letters in all capitals. Why? The reason is that people do not read every letter of a word. Rather, people recognize a word not only by the letters it contains but also by its shape. In other words, people recognize a word by seeing the shapes of the ascending letters (b, d, f, h, k, l, and t) and the descending letters (g, j, p, q, and y). However, when words are typeset in all capitals, the distinguishing shapes from ascenders and descenders are lost.

#### Avoid needless complex phrases
* Another source of needless complexity occurs in phrases in which the author strings modifiers in front of nouns. Because nouns, particularly subject nouns, are stepping-stones in sentences, stringing adjectives and other nouns acting like adjectives in front of those subject nouns confuse readers.
> Solar One is a 10-megawatt solar thermal electric central receiver Barstow power pilot plant.
* If all these modifiers are important, then the engineer should either place them in phrases and clauses around the principal noun plant or work them into multiple sentences: 
> Solar One is a solar-powered pilot plant located near Barstow, California. This plant produces 10 megawatts of electric power by capturing solar energy in a central receiver design.
* Stringing modifiers in front of nouns also dilutes the meanings of the modifiers.

#### Avoid needless complex sentences
> The object of the work was to confirm the nature of electrical breakdown of nitrogen in uniform fields at relatively high pressures and interelectrode gaps that approach those obtained in engineering practice, prior to the determination of the processes that set the criterion for breakdown in the above-mentioned gases and mixtures in uniform and non-uniform fields of engineering significance.
* This sentence stopped me cold. I could not figure out what it was saying. Such a sentence imposes a barrier for readers. Why? One reason is the length: 61 words. That is long. A typical sentence length would be in the teens. Even more of a problem, the sentence tries to communicate multiple ideas.
* Theodore Bernstein, former editor of The New York Times, enjoined his writers: “One idea, one sentence”
* Now, you can write a sentence of 25 to 30 words without that sentence feeling long. To do so, though, you have to give the reader an early clue that the sentence will be long. One way to do that is to start the sentence with a dependent clause. For instance, a sentence that begins with although signals the reader that the sentence will have two parts: (1) a dependent clause beginning with although and ending with a comma, and (2) an independent clause that typically runs the same length.
* How should the original sentence be revised? First, the revision should break the original sentence into smaller sentences: one for each idea.
> This study tests the electrical breakdown of nitrogen in uniform fields. For these tests, the electrode gap distances were typical, while the pressures were relatively high.
* In general, the more complex the original idea is, the more revisions that are needed to clarify that idea.
* Consider another needlessly complex sentence from an engineering report: 
> To separate the hot and cold oil, one tank was used that took advantage of the thermocline principle, which uses the rock and sand bed and the variation of oil density with temperature (8% decrease in density over the range of operating temperatures) to overcome natural convection between the hot and cold regions.
* Before improving this sentence, you should decide which details in the sentence are important. Does the reader need to know how the hot and cold oil are separated, how the density varies in the tank, or what the thermocline principle is? If these details are not important, then delete them. However, if the reader needs to know these details to understand the work, then you should allot at least one sentence to each idea.
* The most well-known equation for measuring the complexity index for a piece of writing is the Gunning Fog Index
* In your writing, you should aim for a reading level between 10 and 13. For a professional reader, such a reading level is efficient. If the reading level is too low, too many sentences would be short, making the writing choppy. If the level is too high, the reader focuses too much of her or his attention on how the document is written, as opposed to what ideas the document contains.

### Balance precision and clarity in illustrations
* the precision of your illustrations should reflect the precision of your language.
* Too often in scientific writing, illustrations confuse rather than inform.
* Unclear illustrations arise not only because of mistakes in the selection of illustrations but also because of mistakes in the language that introduces and labels the illustration. Illustrations cannot stand alone. You need language to mesh the illustration into the document. When you introduce an illustration, you should assign it a formal name and provide enough information, either in the text or in the illustration’s caption or heading, that readers can understand what the illustration is and how it fits into the document. 
* Besides introducing illustrations in the text, you should identify illustrations with a caption or heading.
