# Chapter 1 - Clean Code
* It never will happen - a machine which build systems as soon as we speak the functionalities.
* The only way to make the deadline—the only way to
go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
*  being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!
* A programmer without “code-sense” can look at a messy module and recognize the mess but will have no idea what to do about it. 
* In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen
through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.
* ur code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It should contain only what is necessary. 
*  Clean code is focused. Each
function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely
undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
* Clean code is code that has been taken care of.
* Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions.
That’s what makes clean code for me.
